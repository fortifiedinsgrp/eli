        "The United States and Iran have begun high-stakes nuclear negotiations in Oman, mediated by Omani officials, amid deep disagreements over whether to expand the agenda beyond Tehran's nuclear program to include its missile arsenal. President Trump warned he has military options at his disposal if diplomacy fails, while Germany's incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz voiced concern about further escalation during his Gulf tour. Separately, at least 31 people were killed and over 169 wounded in a suicide bombing at the Khadija al-Kubra Shiite mosque in Islamabad during Friday prayers, one of the deadliest attacks in Pakistan's capital in years.

        "U.S. President Donald Trump gave his 'total endorsement' of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi ahead of Sunday's snap lower-house election, adding he looks forward to hosting her at the White House next month. Polls suggest Takaichi's ruling coalition could win a supermajority, vindicating her decision to call early elections after a trade-and-minerals deal with Washington in October.
